            WHAT WE BACK UP TO THE CLOUD:
            We only back up the Shared Preferences file that stores the last
            (x, y) coordinates of the simulation. This is essential to ensure
            the wallpaper's evolution continues seamlessly if the user
            restores the app on a new device. It is small and contains
            no personally identifiable information.

        <!--
            WHAT WE EXCLUDE FROM CLOUD BACKUP:
            We explicitly exclude the generated wallpaper image itself. It is a large,
            ephemeral artifact that will be regenerated on the next cycle. Backing it up
            would be an inefficient use of the user's cloud storage.

        <!--
            Most importantly, we exclude the entire Room database. It contains
            sensitive, transient user interaction data (typing events). For privacy,
            this data should NEVER leave the device. A user starting on a new phone
            will simply begin a new history.
